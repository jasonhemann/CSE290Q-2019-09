## Current schedule of readings

This list is subject to change, and it is neither sound (i.e., if something's listed here, that doesn't mean we'll read it) nor complete (i.e., if something's *not* listed here, that doesn't mean we *won't* read it).

## Further reading

There's a vast amount of reading material that would be in scope for a course on SMT solving and solver-aided systems, but that this particular course won't have time to cover, including but not limited to:

  - TODO
  - Etc., etc., etc.

<!--
Lecture 1:
sound and complete
do problem 1.3 together or just look at example 1.15
look at example 1.18
look at example 1.19
Tseitin's encoding and getting rid of the right-to-left implications

Need to do 2 more lectures myself.

Need 8 more papers:
Rosette (2)
Liquid Haskell
Potassco
That other system I mentioned to Mike in an email
Indigo
Reluplex
Marabou

Maybe cut a couple lectures from the book if I have more systems to talk about
