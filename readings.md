## Current schedule of readings

This list is subject to change, and it is neither sound (i.e., if something's listed here, that doesn't mean we'll read it) nor complete (i.e., if something's *not* listed here, that doesn't mean we *won't* read it).

## Further reading

### The basics

We'll mostly assume that you are familiar with the basics of **propositional logic**, but if you need a refresher, read [Chapter 1 ("Propositional Logic") of _
_The Calculus of Computation: Decision Procedures with Applications to Verification_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1) by Aaron R. Bradley and Zohar Manna ([off-campus access link (requires CruzID Gold login)](https://link-springer-com.oca.ucsc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1)).  (Bradley and Manna's book is also a good alternative resource for many of the other topics covered in Kroening and Strichman.)

There's a vast amount of reading material that would be in scope for a course on SMT solving and solver-aided systems, but that this particular course won't have time to cover, including but not limited to:

  - ...
  
  <!-- - TODO: Boolector paper? -->

<!--
Lecture 1:
sound and complete
do problem 1.3 together or just look at example 1.15
look at example 1.18
look at example 1.19
Tseitin's encoding and getting rid of the right-to-left implications
-->
