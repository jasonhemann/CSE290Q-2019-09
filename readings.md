## Current schedule of readings

This list is subject to change, and it is neither sound (i.e., if something's listed here, that doesn't mean we'll read it) nor complete (i.e., if something's *not* listed here, that doesn't mean we *won't* read it).

## Further reading

We'll mostly assume that you are familiar with the basics of **propositional logic**, but if you need a refresher, read [Chapter 1 (Propositional Logic) of _The Calculus of Computation: Decision Procedures with Applications to Verification_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1) by Aaron R. Bradley and Zohar Manna ([off-campus access link](https://link-springer-com.oca.ucsc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1)).

Bradley and Manna's book is also a good alternative resource for many of the other topics covered in Kroening and Strichman.

Many of the solver-aided languages and tools we use rely on the Z3 SMT solver.  The standard citation is: Leonardo de Moura and Nikolaj Bjørner, [Z3: an efficient SMT solver (TACAS 2008)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24) ([off-campus access link](https://link-springer-com.oca.ucsc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24)).  If you want to understand Z3, I suggest working through the [tutorial](https://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/guide).

There's a vast amount of reading material that would be in scope for a course on SMT solving and solver-aided systems, but that this particular course won't have time to cover, including but not limited to:

  - ...material on answer set programming systems with integrated solvers, such as:
    - Martin Gebser et al., [Potassco: The Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection (_AI Communications_, 2011)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1971623) ([off-campus access link](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.oca.ucsc.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=4bf38049-468d-4ddd-840e-4795b3e5829a%40pdc-v-sessmgr01)) (see also: [the Potassco website](https://potassco.org/))
  - ...follow-up work on Reluplex, such as:
    - Guy Katz et al., [The Marabou framework for verification and analysis of deep neural networks (CAV 2019)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-25540-4_26.pdf)
  - ...more work on solver-aided systems for ensuring consistency in distributed systems, such as:
    - Farzin Houshman and Mohsen Lesani, [Hamsaz: replication coordination analysis and synthesis (POPL 2019)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3302515.3290387)
  - ...more work on solver-aided languages, such as:
    - William T. Hallahan, Anton Xue, and Ruzica Piskac, [G2Q: Haskell constraint solving (Haskell Symposium 2019)](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/papers/2019HallahanETALquasiquoter.pdf)
    - Aaron Bembenek and Stephen Chong, [FormuLog: Datalog for static analysis involving logical formulae" (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06274)
  - Etc., etc., etc.
