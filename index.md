[SAT](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1536637) and [SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) solvers are now widely used across many areas of computer science, especially for automated software and hardware verification, but they are often "black boxes" to their users.  This course is for those who want to look under the hood to learn how solvers work, and to explore a variety of systems that make use of them.
